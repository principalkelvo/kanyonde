**Kanyode** is a user & computer interactive game. if user selection matches the computer selection, the user wins. If user selection is not equal to equal to the computer selection, the user loses. 
the main problem is in styling the images in rotation form,and still make the images clickable and have an event listener on each image Onclick.
i would like this game to be in circular and make all images be on there own margin and padding but in a rotation formation
